\section{Hypothesis}
Below are our hypotheses. We will test these hypotheses using the data from the HPM survey. We will use the data to test for complementarity between environmental practices and JIT practices. We will also test for the moderating effect of JIT practices on the relationship between environmental practices and emissions to air and solid waste generation.
\\

H1: Environmental practices and JIT practices are complementary: the implementation of JIT practices increases the marginal return of environmental practices on environmental performance and vice versa.
\\

H2: JIT practices negatively moderates the effect of environmental practices on emissions to air and solid waste generation.
