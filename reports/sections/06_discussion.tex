- Check for complimentarity between JIT and EP bundles as per complimentarity paper approaches

- See if there is a better way then just dropping all NA rows

- Test moderating effect of JIT on EP bundles as per china paper

- We need to ask the specifics of the likert scale for the JIT measures

- Apply spell check to latek sections before submitting
