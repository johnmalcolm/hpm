Our research methodology is based on \cite{furlanComplementarityLeanManufacturing2011} who used bundles to test for complementarity amongst an aggregate of practices. 
We were also inspired by \cite{maoLowCarbonSupply2017} use of moderating variables to test for more specific environmental effects.
